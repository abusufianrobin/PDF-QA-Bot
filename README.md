# 📚 PDF Question-Answer Helpline Bot (Hugging Face Based)

This is a smart Question-Answer Helpline Bot built using Hugging Face Transformers. The bot allows users to **upload any PDF book** and then **ask questions**. The system finds **relevant answers** from the content, either extractively or with summarization—depending on the model used.
